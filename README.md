# Dodgeball Plugin
Play a classical game of Dodgeball, eliminate the other team and become the last player standing!

## Purpose
This plugin was developed as part of an application process to a Minecraft network for a Java Developer position. The time frame was **48 hours** and because of the test's requirements, this uses `Spigot` (1.19.4) instead  of `Paper`. This project is not actively maintained nor does it receive support - it is purely an example of my previous work.

## Features
- Classical game of Dodgeball including scoreboards, winning effects, game rules and more.
- Add-on features like persistant statistics of level, coins, lifetime kills and lifetime deaths.
- Classical lobby system with scoreboard and game rules.
- As made with scalability in mind, it is possible to set up how many games as you want and run them simonteneously.
- Easy-to-use built-in setup process that makes it possible for developers and admins to setup games while on the server, without the need of any 3rd-party plugins.
- Persistant game storage, games automatically save on plugin shutdown and load in on startup.
- Supports both local storage and Mongo storage for user data.
- Variety of customizable settings split up in multiple confiugration files for organization.
- Language system with customizable and translatable messages in the messages.yml file.
