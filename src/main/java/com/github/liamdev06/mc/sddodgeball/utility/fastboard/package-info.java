/*
FastBoard is a great lightweight scoreboard API I love to use for projects where there is not enough time
piecing together your own scoreboard system.

I although really want to mention this and clearly get it through as I do not want to take credit for something
I have not done.

The GitHub for this scoreboard API can be found here: https://github.com/MrMicky-FR/FastBoard
